# Product Card Component

This is a React component that displays a product card with details such as brand, title, new price, used price, and an image. The component includes a responsive design and ensures that data is correctly rendered only when available.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The card adjusts its layout based on screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Conditional Rendering**: Ensures that the product details only render when all necessary data (brand, title, price, and image) is available.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Displays loading skeletons for each piece of data while itâ€™s being fetched or is missing.
